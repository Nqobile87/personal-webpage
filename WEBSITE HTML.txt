            <h2>My Previous Work Environments</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I graduated with a master’s in educational psychology at the University of Zululand. After graduating, I completed my internship at the Johannesburg Centre for Psychological Services and Career Development (PSYCAD). After my training, I worked with learners with special needs at Kenmont School, which allowed me to advance my skills in a multidisciplinary team setting. I furthered my career at the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal as a student counsellor, which allowed me to work with students who also struggle with learning challenges.</p>
                <p>In my work at the University of KwaZulu Natal, I provided clinical supervision for Educational Psychology Interns who were placed in the University. This allowed me to further engage with schools and form relationships with all stakeholders involved in providing the best training practice for the intern Educational Psychologists under my care. I believe in working collaboratively with all systems involved in providing the best service for the client.</p>

            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>My approach is predominantly Humanistic, compassionate, and solution-focused. My style is more pragmatic as I believe in providing practical skills for challenges faced by learners.</p>
                <p>I am also trained in conducting full psycho-educational assessments where barriers to learning can be identified and supported within the various systems – individual, family, school, and community. In addition, I have also been trained in career counselling and school-readiness assessments. I understand my clients through the systems approach theory. I believe that a person is a system and comes from a system!</p>
